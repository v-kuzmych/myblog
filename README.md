To start using, you must specify the necessary parameters in the **functions.php** file to connect to your database, such as
1. $hostname     = "localhost";
2. $username     = "root";
3. $password     = "";
4. $databaseName = "test";   

Once connected, a database *$databaseName* and two tables *category* and *news* will be created
